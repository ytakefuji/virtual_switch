# virtual_switch
Two Python programs (fingersw.py and fvsw.py) are given.
fingersw.py works with 1_0LED.ino arduino.
You should install 1_0LED.ino for arduino Nano.
In fingersw.py, locating index-finger-tip in the left-top corner toggles the LED-lighting.

fvsw.py works with firmata arduino.
You should install StandardFirmata for arduino Nano.
In fvsw.py, locating index-finger-tip in the left-top corner lights the LED.

fvsw.py works with firmata arduino.
In fvsw.py, locating index-finger-tip in the left-top corner toggles the LED-lighting.

Firmata is a protocol for communicating with microcontrollers from software on a computer (or smartphone/tablet, etc).
