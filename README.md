# virtual_switch
This repository shows how to integrate artificial intelligence libraries such as mediapipe
with Arduino Nano.

Three Python programs (fingersw.py, fvsw.py, fvswt.py) are disclosed.

# fingersw.py
fingersw.py works with 1_0LED.ino arduino.
You should install 1_0LED.ino on arduino Nano.
In fingersw.py, place the tip of your index finger on the upper left corner 
to toggle the LED lights..

# fvsw.py and fvswt.py
fvsw.py works with firmata arduino.

Firmata is a protocol for communicating with microcontrollers 
from software on a computer (or smartphone/tablet, etc).

You should install StandardFirmata for arduino Nano.

# fvsw.py
In fvsw.py, when placing the tip of your index finger on the upper left corner, 
the LED will light up.

# fvswt.py
fvswt.py works with firmata arduino.
In fvswt.py, placing the tip of your index finger on the upper left corner 
toggles the LED-lighting.
