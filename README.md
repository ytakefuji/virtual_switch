This repository shows how to integrate artificial intelligence libraries such as mediapipe
with Arduino Nano.

Three Python programs (fingersw.py, fvsw.py, fvswt.py) are disclosed.

fingersw.py works with 1_0LED.ino arduino.
You should install 1_0LED.ino on arduino Nano.
In fingersw.py, place the tip of your index finger on the upper left corner 
to toggle the LED lights..

fvsw.py works with firmata arduino.

Firmata is a protocol for communicating with microcontrollers 
from software on a computer (or smartphone/tablet, etc).

You should install StandardFirmata for arduino Nano.

In fvsw.py, when placing the tip of your index finger on the upper left corner, 
the LED will light up.

fvsw.py works with firmata arduino.
In fvsw.py, placing the tip of your index finger on the upper left corner 
toggles the LED-lighting.
